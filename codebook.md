==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- A 79-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- run_analysis.R - R script which transforms the original HAR data set into the tidy data sets mentioned below 
- HARTidyDataSet.txt - Tidy data set created from the original HAR data set. 
- averageDatasetBySubjectAndActivity.txt - Tidy data set created from HARTidyDataSet containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- FeatureNames.txt - List of features included in the data set 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
- Train and test data in original data sets are combined
- 79 features which are measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurement are selected out of the original 561 features.
- Activity labels [1:6] given in original test and train label files are replaced by cotrresponding activity names 
- Columns of the data set are remaned with descriptive feature names
- A second tidy data set is created by calculating mean values of measurements for each activity done by every subject.
